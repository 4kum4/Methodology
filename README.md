# Methodology

I'm doing this because I like the idea of following methodologies as I work in certain areas and I like the idea of keeping track of crazy ideas and recommendations from conferences, blogs, and people
In this repository, I will update my methodologies for different topics. Hopefully, I will be consistent and keep them up to date. 


Some of the topics I enjoy and like to have here are __OSINT__, __Bug Hunting__ & __Hacking__.

## Methodologies
* [SE & OSINT](#SE-&-OSINT)
* [Bug Hunting](#Bug-Hunting)
* [Hacking](#Hacking)



## SE & OSINT
This project is a simple Lorem ipsum dolor generator ATM.
__SE__ or Social Engineering, for me, should go altogether with __OSINT__ as having as many resources possible from a target will help us with a good __pretext__ when we need to do an __active recoinoisence__ on the target.
