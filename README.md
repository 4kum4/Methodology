# Methodology

I'm doing this because I like the idea of following methodologies as I work in certain areas and I like the idea of keeping track of crazy ideas and recommendations from conferences, blogs, and people
In this repository, I will update my methodologies for different topics. Hopefully, I will be consistent and keep them up to date. 


Some of the topics I enjoy and like to have here are __OSINT__, __Bug Hunting__ & __Hacking__.
